# Simple-Game-AI-for-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game played between two participants. The goal of this project is to create a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against an AI opponent. The AI selects its move randomly, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules. The project is implemented in Python 
 Methodology:
1.	User Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter either "rock," "paper," or "scissors." It also provides an option to quit the game.
2.	AI Move Generation: The AI opponent randomly selects one of the three choices using Python's random.choice() function.
3.	Winner Determination: The game logic compares the user’s choice and AI’s choice to determine the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
